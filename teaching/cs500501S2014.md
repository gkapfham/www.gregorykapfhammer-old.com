{% describe %}
A corequisite seminar for all students participating in the Internship Program.  Internship students enroll twice, once
prior to and once following the Internship. Computer Science 500 focuses on expectations and planning, leading to the
Internship Proposal required for all students planning an internship.  Computer Science 501 provides the opportunity for
students who have completed the Internship to prepare written and oral reports on the Internship experience. The
student, in consultation with the faculty of the Department of Computer Science, is responsible for arranging for an
acceptable internship.  The courses meet together weekly for one-half a semester. Credit: One semester hour for each
course. Prerequisites: Completion of at least two core courses.
