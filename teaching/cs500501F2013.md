Computer Science 501 provides the opportunity for students who have completed
the Internship to prepare written and oral reports on the Internship
experience. The student, in consultation with the faculty of the Department of
Computer Science, is responsible for arranging for an acceptable internship.
The courses meet together weekly for one-half a semester. Credit: One semester
hour for each course. Prerequisites: Completion of at least two core courses.
