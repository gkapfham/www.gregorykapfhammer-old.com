{% describe %}
An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a
programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational
structures needed to solve problems and produce artifacts such as interactive games and computer-mediated art and music.
Students also learn how to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the
intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer
science and computational thinking. One laboratory per week. Prerequisite: Knowledge of elementary algebra. Distribution
Requirements: ME, SP.
