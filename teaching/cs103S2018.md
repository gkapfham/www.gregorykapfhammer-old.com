## Description

{% describe %}
An introduction to the principles and applications of computer science with an
emphasis on understanding intercultural perspectives that arise during the
design, implementation, and maintenance of mobile-ready web sites.
Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students
learn the computational methods needed to create web sites that are useful to
people from different cultures and nationalities. Students also investigate
approaches to developing efficient, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing web
sites that adhere to the international standards set by the World Wide Web
Consortium. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art
web development technologies to complete projects, reporting on their results
through both written documents and oral presentations. Prerequisite: Knowledge
of elementary algebra. Distribution Requirements: IP, SP.
