{% describe %}
An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on
creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating
in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the
computational structures needed to solve problems and produce artifacts such as
interactive games and computer-mediated art and music. Students also learn how
to organize and document a programâ€™s source code so that it effectively
communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the
introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and
computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use
state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results
through both written documents and oral presentations. Prerequisite: Knowledge
of elementary algebra. Distribution Requirements: ME, SP.
