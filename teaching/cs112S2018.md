## Description

{% describe %}
A continuation of CMPSC 111 with an emphasis on implementing, using, and
evaluating the computational structures needed to efficiently store and
retrieve digital data. Participating in hands-on activities that often require
teamwork, students create data structures and algorithms whose correctness and
performance they study through proofs and experimentation. Students continue to
refine their ability to organize and document a program's source code so that it
effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. During a
weekly laboratory session, students use state-of-the-art technology to complete
projects, reporting on their results through both written reports and oral
presentations. Prerequisite: CMPSC 111 or permission of the instructor.
Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.
