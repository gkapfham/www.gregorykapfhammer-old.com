{% describe %}
A human-centric study of the principles used during the engineering of high-quality software systems. In addition to
examining the human behaviors and social processes undergirding software development methodologies, students participate
in teams tasked with designing, developing, and delivering a significant software application for a customer. During a
weekly laboratory session, students use state-of-the-art software engineering, management, and communication tools to
complete projects, reporting on their results through both written reports and oral presentations. Prerequisite: CMPSC
112. Distribution Requirements: SB, SP.
