A continuation of CMPSC 480, with a focus on the collaborative enhancement of
innovative software. While partnering with members of the course and receiving
mentorship from experts in the software community, students document, improve,
and maintain a publicly available software tool. During a weekly practical
session, students use state-of-the-art technology to complete and release a
significant software product, describing it through oral presentations and
written documents featured on a web site. Prerequisite: CMPSC 203 and CMPSC 480.
Distribution Requirements: none.
