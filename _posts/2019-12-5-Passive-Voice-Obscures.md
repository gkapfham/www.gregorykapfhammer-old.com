Through my [service]({{site.baseurl}}service/) as an associate editor for the
[Journal of Software: Evolution and
Process](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20477481), an academic editor
for the [PeerJ Computer Science](https://peerj.com/computer-science/) journal,
and a program committee member for conferences like the [International
Conference on Software Testing, Verification and
Validation](https://cs.gmu.edu/icst/index.html), I've read a lot of research
papers in the field of software engineering and software testing.

Do you have your own tips about how to effectively write a research paper? Have
you noticed sentence structures that make it difficult for you to effectively
explain your idea? If you have, then I hope that you will
[contact]({{site.baseurl}}contact/) me to share some of your thoughts. Or, do
you want to be updated when I publish new blog posts like this one? If you do,
then please [subscribe]({{site.baseurl}}support/) to my mailing list.
