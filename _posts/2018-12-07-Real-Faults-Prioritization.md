In a previous post, called [Regression testing of software is costly &mdash; but
you can do something about it!]({% post_url 2017-07-03-Regression-Testing-Costs
%}), I pointed out that software engineers often write test suites that they
will re-run as they modify a program. This process, called regression testing,
helps developers to ensure that they have not introduced new defects as they add
new features or bug fixes.

Instead of focuses on the practices of software engineers, in this post I

How do you perform regression testing of your software? How do you
experimentally study regression testing techniques? I invite you to
