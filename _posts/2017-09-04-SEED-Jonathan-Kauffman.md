{% describe %}
As part of the [SEED project]({{ site.baseurl | slice: 0, size }}{% post_url
2017-07-05-Introducing-SEED %}), I recently talked with [Jonathan Miller
Kauffman]({{page.web_site}}), a {{page.title_name}} at {{page.company_name}}.
In this interview, Jonathan shared with me that, while technical skills are
necessary, software engineers must be effective communicators. Jonathan also
stressed both the importance of repeatedly practicing key skills and the need for
continuous learning. Read Jonathan's responses to the three SEED questions to
learn more about his unique perspective on the engineering of software.

## What is one fun fact that you can share about your company or a current project?

Coveros does not have an office space that they own or rent in which employees
can work. Instead, employees either work at client sites or from their homes.
Whenever we need to meet as a company, we rent meeting spaces. This reduces
the company's fixed costs and allows us to be more profitable.

## What is the greatest challenge that you face when working in your field?

Although there are often significant technical challenges involved with
understanding how existing software works or when trying to develop a new
feature, the most significant and pervasive challenge is with communication.
Making sure that all stakeholders (e.g., the business, analysts, developers,
and testers) have the same understanding of the software that is going to be
developed is extremely important yet very hard to achieve. Learning how to
identify your assumptions and the assumptions that others may be making will
enable you to more effectively communicate and therefore develop software that
better meets the needs of people.

## What is one point of advice that you can give to people who plan to enter your field?

The ability to learn new skills and technologies is necessary for anyone who
plans to enter the software industry. I recommend that anyone who wants to
work in this field develop a habit of continuous learning and practice. This
could be as simple as spending time reading about an area of interest on a
daily basis. What action someone decides to take is less important than the
consistency with which they take that action.

Do you have any questions about this interview? Or, do you have a response to
Jonathan's ideas? If you do, then I hope that you will
