{% describe %}
As part of the [SEED project]({{ site.baseurl | slice: 0, size }}{% post_url
2017-07-05-Introducing-SEED %}), I recently talked with [Kara
King]({{page.web_site}}), a {{page.title_name}} at {{page.company_name}}. In
this interview, Kara told me that students should be open to learning new
programming languages. Kara also said that software engineers in industry face
the challenge of eliciting requirements from business stakeholders. Finally,
she stressed the importance of professional networking, encouraging people to
pursue internships throughout their undergraduate education. Read Kara's
responses to the three SEED questions to learn more about her unique
perspective on the engineering of software in industry.

## What is one fun fact that you can share about your company or a current project?

FirstEnergy has a wide range of jobs, with the information technology (IT)
division focusing on the use of three different programming languages. So,
there are always areas in which you can learn and grow at FirstEnergy! I use
ABAP or the Advanced Business Application Programming language. ABAP is the
language for SAP and is written in German &mdash; so if you know German, ABAP
may be the development language for you!

## What is the greatest challenge that you face when working in your field?

The greatest challenge I face as a developer at FirstEnergy is communicating
with business stakeholders. As a developer you must take business requirements
and turn them into code &mdash; however, many times the business clients do not
even know themselves what they want in their desired product!

## What is one point of advice that you can give to people who plan to enter your field?

Networking is a huge advantage when searching for a job. I still network in my
current job in case I have a desire to "test the waters" in a different part of
my company. Also, take advantage of internships &mdash; they get your foot in
the door!

Do you have any questions about this interview? Or, do you have a response to
Kara's ideas? If you do, then I hope that you will
