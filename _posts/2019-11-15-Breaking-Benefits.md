My [research]({{site.baseurl}}research/) in the fields of software engineering
and software testing focuses on the design, implementation, and experimental
evaluation of automated techniques for finding and fixing the defects that lead
to software failure. Even though much of my professional work focuses on
developing methods to avoid software failure, I've also learning that when
software fails it is an opportunity for me to learn about why it failed and to
explore alternatives to, for instance, the approach that lead to failure or the
software that itself failed. After reflecting on my research and teaching
experiences, it is now clear that I've greatly benefited from software failures!
Here are a few examples that help to illustrate my point.
