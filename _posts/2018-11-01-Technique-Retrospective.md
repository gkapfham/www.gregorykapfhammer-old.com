{% describe %}
Many of the articles on my [blog]({{site.baseurl}}blog/), describe the tools
that I use when I prepare my [courses]({{site.baseurl}}teaching/), conduct
[research]({{site.baseurl}}research/), write
[papers]({{site.baseurl}}research/papers/), and implement
[software]({{site.baseurl}}software/). Given the rapid pace of innovation in the
field of software engineering, I thought that it would be a good idea to share a
status update on my use of the software that I suggested in previous posts.

What software tools do you use when you implement software or write technical
articles? I invite you to [contact]({{site.baseurl}}contact/) me with your own
suggestions for innovative software.
