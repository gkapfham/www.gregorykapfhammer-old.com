{% describe %}
To arrange a meeting with me during my office hours, please try to <a
href="https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UU9NbDBvclJCQjlQfGRlZmF1bHR8YTlkNzM1MzFiMTUxNDhhYTc2ZDI2MDhmM2ZiZWJjZGE">Schedule
an Appointment</a>&mdash;you can browse my available office hours and pick a
time slot that fits into our schedules. Once you have chosen your appointment,
it will appear in both your Google Calendar and mine. If you would like to see
where I am during any week of the academic semester, you may <a

My Calendar</a>&mdash;but please note that my schedule is not regularly updated
during any of <a href="http://www.allegheny.edu">Allegheny College</a>'s breaks
that are documented in the <a href =
"http://sites.allegheny.edu/dean/academic-calendar/">Academic Calendar</a>.
Individuals seeking to schedule an appointment with me should also bear in mind
that, as Chair of the [Department of Computer
Science](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu) at Allegheny College, I have additional
responsibilities that may prevent me from either holding office hours beyond
those normally scheduled or agreeing to extra meetings outside of office hours.
