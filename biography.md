{% describe %}
[Gregory M. Kapfhammer]({{site.baseurl}}) is an Associate Professor in and
Chair of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu) at
[Allegheny College](http://www.allegheny.edu). He earned his PhD from the
[Department of Computer Science](https://cs.pitt.edu) at the [University of
Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu); his PhD dissertation research was supervised
by [Mary Lou Soffa](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~soffa/). Kapfhammer also earned
a BSc in Computer Science from Allegheny College and a MSc in Computer Science
from the University of Pittsburgh. Kapfhammer was previously a short-term
visitor in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.virginia.edu) at
the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu), the [Institute of
Applied Information Processing](http://iai.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/en/index.html)
at the [University of Ulm](http://www.uni-ulm.de/en), and the [Department of

The paper {% cite Kapfhammer2003 %} was selected to receive the ACM SIGSOFT
Distinguished Paper Award at the [2003 ACM SIGSOFT Foundations of Software
Engineering Conference (ESEC/FSE 2003)](http://esecfse.cs.helsinki.fi/).
Gregory Kapfhammer's paper  {% cite Conrad2010a %} was also recognized as the
best paper in the [Search-Based Software Engineering
Track](http://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2010/organizers-tracks.html#sbse) of the
[2010 ACM SIGEVO Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO
2010)](http://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2010/). Additionally, Kapfhammer's
presentation for {% cite Kapfhammer2016 %} won the best presentation award at
the [2016 International Workshop on Search-Based Software
Testing](https://cse.sc.edu/~ggay/sbst2016/). He frequently serves the research
community as a reviewer for conferences and journals, technical program
committee member, program co-chair for workshops and conferences, workshop
co-chair and program co-chair, and review panelist at the U.S. National Science
Foundation.

As an outworking of his Christian faith, Gregory Kapfhammer's endeavors are
guided by the following professional principles:

<b>Principle 1 (Selfless Service)</b>: Focus on the needs of your students and
colleagues before considering your own. Commit to respectfully serving others
even when your actions are unlikely to be noticed, rewarded, or beneficial to
your own professional development.

<b>Principle 2 (Absolute Excellence)</b>: Devote yourself and encourage others
to commit themselves to uncompromising excellence in all aspects of personal and
professional development.

**Principle 3 (Relentless Effort)**: Unless the opportunity cost of further
effort is prohibitively high, work hard towards the accomplishment of the goals
you set &mdash; and help others to do the same.

**Principle 4 (Realistic Expectations)**: Recognize that all people, including
yourself, have fundamental strengths and weaknesses.  Identify the strengths in
your own life and the lives of others and plan activities so as to maximize the
positive impact on the community.

**Principle 5 (Contagious Joy)**: Pursue everything with passion and enthusiasm.
Take advantage of every opportunity to encourage your students and colleagues.
Always end a conversation or a meeting with a positive remark.
