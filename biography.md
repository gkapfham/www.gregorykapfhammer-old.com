As an outworking of his Christian faith, Gregory Kapfhammer's endeavors are
guided by the following professional principles:

<b>Principle 1 (Selfless Service)</b>: Focus on the needs of your students and
colleagues before considering your own. Commit to respectfully serving others
even when your actions are unlikely to be noticed, rewarded, or beneficial to
your own professional development.

<b>Principle 2 (Absolute Excellence)</b>: Devote yourself and encourage others
to commit themselves to uncompromising excellence in all aspects of personal and
professional development.

<b>Principle 3 (Relentless Effort)</b>: Unless the opportunity cost of further
effort is prohibitively high, work hard towards the accomplishment of the goals
you set &mdash; and help others to do the same.

<b>Principle 4 (Realistic Expectations)</b>: Recognize that all people,
including yourself, have fundamental strengths and weaknesses. Identify the
strengths in your own life and the lives of others and plan activities so as to
maximize the positive impact on the community.

<b>Principle 5 (Contagious Joy)</b>: Pursue everything with passion and
enthusiasm. Take advantage of every opportunity to encourage your students and
colleagues. Always end a conversation or a meeting with a positive remark.
