{% describe %}
As an experimental computer scientist, the goal of my research is to design,
implement, and rigorously evaluate techniques and tools that support the
creation of useful, dependable, and efficient software. My research addresses
the challenges within the fields of software engineering, software testing, and
computer systems. I conduct this research in collaboration with undergraduates
at [Allegheny College](http://www.allegheny.edu), graduate students and
professors at other universities, and colleagues in industry.
{% enddescribe %}

My research is empirical in nature because it involves the application of the
scientific method to formulate problem statements, carry out experiments, take
observations, statistically analyze and visualize the data sets, and draw
conclusions based on the experimental results. Each research project focuses on
the development and evaluation of [software]({{site.baseurl}}software/)
artifacts that can be used in both empirical studies and real-world practice by
undergraduate and graduate students, software engineers, and computer scientists
in both academia and industry. In addition to supporting my professional
[service]({{site.baseurl}}service/), my research also results in award-winning
and frequently cited research [papers]({{site.baseurl}}research/papers/),
oft-complimented [presentations]({{site.baseurl}}research/presentations/), and
useful free and open-source [software]({{site.baseurl}}software/).

My research has concentrated on several important areas, examples of which are
summarized in the following list that references key papers.

<ul class="fa-ul">

<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-right"></i>

<b>Database Testing:</b> Since the database application is a complex artifact
that must be verified, my PhD dissertation {% include
_popovers/paper_reference.html cite="Kapfhammer2007d" %} presented an approach
for testing database applications; a notable paper derived from my dissertation
is {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html cite="Kapfhammer2003"
trailing="." %} My work has also focused on testing the schema of a relational
database, with {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html cite="McMinn2016a" %}
and {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html cite="McMinn2015" %} being
examples of papers.
</li>
<p>

<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-right"></i>

<b>Web Testing:</b> In response to the prevalence and complexity of mobile-ready
web sites, my research has developed automated techniques for checking these
sites. Some examples of papers describing approaches that have found defects in
live, production web sites include {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html
cite="Walsh2015" trailing="," %} and {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html
cite="Walsh2017" trailing="," %} and {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html
cite="Walsh2017a" trailing="." %}

</li>
<p>

<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-right"></i>

<b>Mutation Testing:</b> Given the challenges associated with evaluating the
quality of a test suite, my research has designed efficient ways to perform test
assessment through mutation analysis. Considering both programs and relational
database schemas, some examples of papers include {% include
_popovers/paper_reference.html cite="Just2012b" trailing="," %} {% include
_popovers/paper_reference.html cite="Wright2014" trailing="," %} and {% include
_popovers/paper_reference.html cite="McMinn2018" trailing="." %}
</li>
<p>

<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-right"></i>

<b>Regression Testing:</b> Since software is often incrementally developed, my
work on regression testing has created automated ways to efficiently and
effectively run test suites for complex programs. Some examples of papers that
present and evaluate regression testing techniques include {% include
_popovers/paper_reference.html cite="Walcott2006" trailing="," %} {% include
_popovers/paper_reference.html cite="Lin2014" trailing="," %} and {% include
_popovers/paper_reference.html cite="Lin2017" trailing="."%}
</li>
<p>

<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-right"></i>

<b>Search-Based Testing:</b> Using a fitness function as a guide to a suitable
solution, search-based methods have shown promise in a many domains. My work has
focused on creating frameworks to support the development of search-based tools,
with {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html cite="McMinn2016b" %} being one
paper. Papers such as {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html
cite="Conrad2010a" %} and {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html
cite="Kukunas2010a" %} describe and assess other search-based solutions to
software engineering challenges.
</li>
<p>

<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-right"></i>

<b>Research Methods:</b> My surveys of the research landscape in the field of
software testing provide a starting point for individuals exploring this field,
with {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html cite="Kapfhammer2004" %} and {%
include _popovers/paper_reference.html cite="Kapfhammer2010" %} being examples
of papers. Moreover, papers like {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html
cite="Kapfhammer2016" %} and {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html
cite="McMinn2016" %} illustrate ways in which I have articulated a research
agenda for the field of software engineering. Finally, I have written papers
like {% include _popovers/paper_reference.html cite="Alsharif2018a" %} and {%
include _popovers/paper_reference.html cite="Alsharif2018b" %} that explain how
to replicate my research results.
