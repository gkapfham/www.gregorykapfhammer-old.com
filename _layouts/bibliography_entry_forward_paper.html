<!-- NOTE: The "entry-forward" layout controls how the single-paper listing will display on the index -->

<!-- This is a paper and thus we always display the title of the paper and link to the details page -->
<!-- Make this part of the featured class so that there is less space on the bottom margin
     and the entries do not take up the entire width of the current div. -->
<div class="featured">
<a class="major" href="/research/papers/{{entry.key}}">{{entry.title}}</a>
<!-- If there is a "booktitle" (i.e., proceedings), then display its name -->
<br>
{% if entry.booktitle %}
{{ entry.booktitle }}
<!-- If there is a "journal" (i.e., it is a journal), then display its name -->
{% elsif entry.journal %}
{{ entry.journal}}
{% endif %}
