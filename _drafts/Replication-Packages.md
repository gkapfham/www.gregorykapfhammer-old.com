{% describe %}
Prior research and development experiences have proven the Alternating Variable Method (AVM) to be a fast and effective
local search technique for search-based software engineering. Moreover, recent improvements to the AVM have generalized
the representations it can optimize and have provably reduced its running time. However, until recently, there has been no
general, publicly-available implementation of the AVM incorporating all of these developments.
